# Stock Price Visualization Project

## Overview
This project is a replica of a more complex program developed as part of a university project. Unfortunately, the original file was lost, and due to an oversight, it was not saved properly. The original project had more advanced features, including visual complexity, and utilized machine learning algorithms such as linear regression for stock price predictions. This current version serves as a demo and will be updated to include more features in the future.

## Functionality
The program allows users to visualize historical stock prices for selected companies. It fetches data from Yahoo Finance using the `yfinance` library and displays the closing prices in a matplotlib plot embedded within a tkinter window. Users can select a stock from a dropdown menu, choose start and end dates using calendar widgets, and click a button to generate the plot.

## Usage
1. **Select Stock**: Choose a stock from the dropdown menu (AAPL, GOOG, MSFT, AMZN).
2. **Select Dates**: Use the calendar widgets to select the start and end dates for the historical data.
3. **Generate Plot**: Click the "Plot" button to generate and display the stock price plot.

## Future Updates
This program is a work in progress, and future updates may include the following enhancements:
- Implementing more advanced visualizations.
- Incorporating predictive analysis using machine learning algorithms.
- Improving the user interface for better usability.
- Adding additional features based on user feedback.
